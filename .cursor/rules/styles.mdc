- Zacre uses DaisyUI for efficient styling with TailwindCSS. Please refer to its docs if possible.

- Please try to create beautiful elements for modules.

- Use only theme colors.

- Remember to style modules in Zacre in a flexible way, as we don't know for sure if user while making a layout would
  want modules to be placed in a row (X axis values) (less width) or a column (full width).

- Standard padding and gap values are multiplication of 4.

- Returned JSX Element of loader or render function must be an HTML element, as we insert engine neccesary data attributes later on.

- Every button, link button should have its own icon from Lucide library placed on the left, constructed like this:
  `<button class="btn"><i data-lucide="pencil" class="w-4 h-4></i>Edit</button>`
  After adding icon, please double-check if this icon is included in client-side icon initializing
  function, located in `src/lib/client/icons.ts`.

- Positioning of buttons, links, actions should be on the right (justify-end) of the subject body, such as cards, modals.

- Use semantic HTML whenever possible.

- If there is a possibility that a styled component with JSX would be re-used, it should be a new reusable component inside
  `src/components/modules-ui` directory, as seen with `src/components/modules-ui/typography.tsx` JSX functions.
